# JSON Parser ðŸ¤¯

This project is a JSON parser written in TS. It allows you to parse JSON data and extract information from it. The ideia is to make it lightweight and easy to use to use this parser in another projects.

## Todo List

- [x] Implement basic JSON parsing functionality
- [x] Handle nested JSON objects and arrays
- [x] Implement error handling for invalid JSON input
- [x] Write unit tests to ensure the parser functions correctly
- [x] Add support to negative numbers
- [ ] Add support to escape characters
- [ ] Add support to scientific notation, maybe
